# Data Structures

## Things that are there:-
    Unit 2 only:-
    1. AVL
    2. Splay (Does not work as of now)
    3. Doubly Threaded Binary tree.
    4. Graph (Have not checked it works or not)
    5. Hashmaps (Seperate channing works but the logic used is not good as for probing I have only written for Linear probing (But not the driver code))
    6. Trie Tree (I have to still complete).
    7. B Tree (I have to start with it).
